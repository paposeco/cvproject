Nothing happens when you click submit CV, but it was a good way to pratice react.

I struggled for a good bit, but decided to restart from scratch. Best decision ever.

## Features

Only Personal Information and Education are required. The Education and Work Experience sections might have multiple entries.
The user can also upload a photo by submitting an url.

Side note: I don't know what I was going for with the styling, but I don't hate it.
